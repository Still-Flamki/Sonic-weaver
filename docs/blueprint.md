## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey a sense of modern audio technology and energy.
- Background color: Light blue (#E1F5FE) - A bright, desaturated tint of the primary for a clean, spacious feel.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0) - An analogous hue used to draw attention to interactive elements like buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' provides a techy look for the title. 'Inter' works perfectly as a body and complements it in the other roles.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent audio processing and download functions.
- Implement subtle animations during audio processing and transitions between states (uploading, processing, download).
- Clean and modern layout with a focus on user-friendliness. Clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the process.
