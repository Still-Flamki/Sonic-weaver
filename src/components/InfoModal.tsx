            <h4>The Technology: Web Audio API & HRTF</h4>
            <p>
              This app uses the powerful{' '}
              <strong>Web Audio API</strong> built into modern browsers to
              manipulate audio in real-time. The core of the spatial effect comes
              from the <strong>PannerNode</strong>, which is set to the 'HRTF'
              (Head-Related Transfer Function) panning model.
            </p>
            <p>
              HRTF is a high-fidelity spatialization algorithm that simulates how
              our ears perceive sound in a 3D space. It accounts for tiny
              differences in timing, volume, and frequency between our left and
              right ears to create a convincing, immersive soundscape that you can
              perceive with any pair of standard headphones.

            <h4>Effect Breakdowns</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>4D: Wide Arc</strong>
              <br />
              This effect creates a clean, wide sweep in front of the listener.
              The sound moves in a semi-circle from far left to far right,
              providing a sense of width and movement without being overly
              distracting. It's great for adding a professional stereo polish to a
              track.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>8D: Circle</strong>
              <br />
              The classic "8D Audio" effect. The sound source orbits your head in a
              perfect 360-degree circle. This creates a continuous sense of motion
              and is popular for creating a hypnotic, engaging listening
              experience, especially in electronic and ambient music.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>11D: Figure-8</strong>
              <br />
              This is the most complex path, adding a vertical dimension to the
              movement. The sound travels in a figure-eight pattern, moving not
              just left-to-right but also up-and-down. This effect also includes
              dynamic gain and filteringâ€”the sound gets quieter and darker when
              it's further away or behind you, creating a highly realistic and
              dynamic sense of space.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Custom</strong>
              <br />
              This mode gives you direct control over the audio engine. You can
              mix and match parameters to design your own unique spatial effects,
              from subtle enhancements to wild, creative soundscapes.
